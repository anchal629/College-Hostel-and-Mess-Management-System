# College Hostel & Mess Management System

**MySQL**

## Project Overview

The **College Hostel & Mess Management System** is designed to streamline the process of hostel allotment and mess preferences for students. The system uses a MySQL database to efficiently handle both simple and complex queries, ensuring seamless management of student information and hostel/mess preferences.

### Primary Objectives:
- Create a hostel and mess database to improve allotment procedures with both basic and complex queries.
- Implement advanced database features such as views, functions, procedures, and triggers.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for students and administrators to access allocation information and manage mess preferences.

## Features

- **Hostel and Mess Database**: Comprehensive database designed to improve the allotment process.
- **ERR Model**: Implemented an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model to map out the relationships between entities.
- **Procedures, Views, Functions, and Triggers**: Advanced database functionalities to manage and automate various tasks.
- **Student Allocation Interface**: An easy-to-use interface for students to view hostel allocation and manage mess preferences.

## Tech Stack

### Database:
- **MySQL**: The database backend is built on MySQL, using advanced querying and database management techniques to handle data efficiently.

## Key Implementation Details:

- **ERR Model**: The Enhanced Entity-Relationship model was implemented to ensure the correct structure of the data and the relationships between different entities such as students, hostels, and mess facilities.
- **Stored Procedures**: Stored procedures were created to manage frequent operations such as hostel allocation and mess preference updates.
- **Views**: Views were used to simplify the retrieval of complex data from the database.
- **Functions & Triggers**: Functions were implemented for repetitive tasks, while triggers were set up to automatically execute predefined actions on certain database events.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **MySQL**: Ensure MySQL is installed and running. You can download it from [here](https://www.mysql.com/).

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/college-hostel-mess-management-system.git
2. **Import the SQL Database**:
   Use the provided .sql file to set up the database in MySQL.
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < path_to_sql_file.sql

3. **Run Queries**:
   Use MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line to run queries and interact with the system.
4. **Access the Application**:
   Once the database is set up, you can interact with it using a frontend application (if any) or directly through MySQL.
